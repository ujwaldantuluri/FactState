# Trustify – An AI-Driven Multi-Domain Scam and Misinformation Detection System

**Problem Description**

The increasing dependence on digital platforms for employment, online shopping, and information consumption has resulted in a rapid rise of scams and misinformation, posing serious threats to user safety and societal trust. Fake job offers lead to financial and identity fraud, deceptive e-commerce listings mislead consumers, and false or misleading news spreads misinformation at an unprecedented scale. These challenges are further intensified by the emergence of AI-generated text and images, which closely resemble legitimate content and are difficult to detect through traditional methods.

Existing solutions are often rule-based, domain-specific, or manually moderated, making them ineffective against evolving fraud patterns and large-scale digital data. There is a critical need for an intelligent, adaptive, and scalable AI-based system capable of analyzing content across multiple domains.

TruthGuard AI addresses this need by proposing a full-stack, AI-driven detection framework that leverages machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to identify fake job offers, fraudulent product listings, misleading news statements, and suspicious textual or visual content. The system provides accurate classifications along with confidence scores and explainable insights, enabling users to make informed decisions and enhancing trust in digital ecosystems.
